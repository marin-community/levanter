# This is hard for me to think about.

# We use GlobalDeviceArrays to coordinate data loading. A GlobalDeviceArray is an array that has a global shape
# but only has the data for some of the chunks of the array (namely, the ones on the local devices). Data can be
# replicated across devices, so that more than one device has the same chunk of data. This is useful for
# data or model parallelism.
# GlobalDeviceArrays are constructed using from_batched_callback, which passes in a list of slices that correspond to
# the entries in the GDA.
#
# For our purposes (data loading), we want to load batches of data from a dataset. We want to load the data in a
# way that is compatible with the GDA, so that we can use the GDA to coordinate the data loading.
# For standard language modeling tasks, the data is a sequence of tokens of some length, so the GDA has shape
# (batch_size, num_tokens). We want to load batches of data that are compatible with this shape.
# The device mesh is (data, model), and we want to replicate data across the model axis. We partition the above array as
# (data, None), meaning that the batch axis is distributed across the data axis. Each process is responsible for
# loading data for its devices. GDA's from_batched_callback will tell us how much data to load and for which device, so
# we just have to load it. We do need to make sure that, in the event the data axis is larger than
# num_devices_per_process, each process that is part of the same position in the device mesh loads the same data.
