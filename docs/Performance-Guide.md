# Performance Guide

## Introduction

This is the very beginnings of a performance guide for Levanter. It's currently mostly a collection of notes and ideas,
but it will eventually be a comprehensive guide to optimizing Levanter (and potentially other JAX programs).

See also the [JAX Profiling Guide](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/profiling.html)

## Profiling

### Enabling the Profiler

Levanter uses JAX's built-in profiler. You can enable it by adding the `--trainer.profiler true` flag
to the command line. This will generate a trace file in the `./logs` directory, under `./logs/<run_id>/profiler/plugins/profile/<datetime>`.
(Yeah, it's a mess, but it's what JAX wants to do.)
It will also upload the information to the relevant tracker (such as Weights & Biases or TensorBoard).

Install profiling dependencies (TensorBoard) with one of:

- `pip install "levanter[profiling]"`
- `uv sync --extra profiling`

Here are the full list of profiling related options:

| Argument                           | Description | Default |
|------------------------------------|-------------|---------|
| `--trainer.profiler`               | Enable the profiler | `false` |
| `--trainer.profiler_start_step`    | The step to start profiling | `5`     |
| `--trainer.profiler_num_steps`     | The number of steps to profile | `100`   |
| `--trainer.profiler_perfetto_link` | Whether to generate a Perfetto URL | `false` |

As usual, these can be specified in the yaml configuration file as well.

In a multi-process setup, each node will save a profile, but only the first node will upload it to the tracker.
All of them will be available in the `./logs` directory (on each node).


### Examining a Profile

See the [JAX Profiling Guide](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/profiling.html) for more information on how to examine a profile.

JAX offers two main ways to examine a profile: Perfetto and TensorBoard.

#### Perfetto

[Perfetto](https://ui.perfetto.dev/) is a web-based tool for examining profiles.

We automatically save Perfetto traces and log them to WandB as artifacts. You can download the trace from WandB and use Perfetto to examine it.
To find the trace, go to the run's page on WandB and click on the "Artifacts" tab. Then click on the `jax_profile` artifact, and navigate to the "Files" tab.
Click `plugins` then `profile` then a date, then download `perfetto_trace.json.gz`.
You can then go to https://ui.perfetto.dev/ and upload the file.

Alternatively, you can enable the `--trainer.profiler_perfetto_link` flag.
This will generate a link that will automatically upload the `perfetto_trace.json.gz` file in the same directory as the TensorBoard profile.
This link is a little tricky to use on TPU. The JAX guide has [some instructions](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/profiling.html#remote-profiling)
on how to use it. (Basically, set up SSH port forwarding and then use the link in your local browser.)

#### TensorBoard

TensorBoard is a locally-run tool for examining profiles.
You want to download the trace files (e.g. `plugins/profile/2024_03_16_07_26_24`)
and run `tensorboard --logdir <dir>` where `<dir>` is the *directory containing plugins* (not the plugins directory itself).
Then you can navigate to http://localhost:6006/#profile in your browser and see the profile.

TensorBoard install tips:

- Avoid installing both stable and nightly variants together (e.g., `tensorboard` and `tb-nightly`).
  If you see “Duplicate plugins” errors, uninstall all TB/TF variants and reinstall a single choice.
- If the Profile plugin fails to load with a Protobuf version error, align major versions:
  - Upgrade Protobuf runtime to 6.x: `pip install -U 'protobuf>=6,<7'` (or `uv pip install -U 'protobuf>=6,<7'`).
  - Ensure `xprof` matches your TensorBoard (stable TB → `xprof`, nightly TB → `xprof-nightly`).
  - Restart TensorBoard after upgrading.

There are three sections I find particularly useful:

1. The overview page tells you MMU utilization and the top 10 operations.
2. **op_profile** shows you the time spent in each operation (by type). You end up with annoying names like `fusion.1772`,
but with some patience and work you can back those out by looking at the next section (under XLA Ops).
3. **trace_viewer** shows you the actual trace of operations as a big timeline. It takes a long time to load.

## Interpreting JAX terms in profiles

* `jvp(OP)` means the forward pass. (JVP stands for Jacobian-vector product.)
* `transpose(jvp(OP))` means the backward pass.
* `remat` (short for rematerialization) means that the operation is recomputed in the backward pass, i.e. gradient checkpointing.
